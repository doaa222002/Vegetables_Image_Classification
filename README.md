# Vegetables Image Classification
# Dataset Description :-
This dataset focuses on the classification of various types of vegetables commonly consumed around the world. It contains 21,000 images representing 15 vegetable types: Broccoli, Capsicum, Bottle Gourd, Radish, Tomato, Brinjal, Pumpkin, Carrot, Papaya, Cabbage, Bitter Gourd, Cauliflower, Bean, Cucumber, and Potato. Each vegetable is visually distinct due to its shape, color, and texture, making it suitable for classification tasks in agricultural or food-related AI applications.

# Dataset Distribution:
Training set: 15,000 images

Testing set: 3,000 images

Validation set: 3,000 images

The dataset was processed and used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. By leveraging the CNN model's ability to extract hierarchical features such as edges, textures, and shapes, the system can effectively distinguish between different vegetable types. This dataset aids in automating the classification process, which could be applied in agriculture, supermarkets, or food quality assurance systems.
